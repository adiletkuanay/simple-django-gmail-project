# simple-django-gmail-project
The Simple Django Gmail Project is a web application that allows users to send and receive emails using a simplified version of the Gmail interface. 
Users can create an account and securely log in to the application. 
Users can compose new emails by specifying the recipient(s), subject, and message content. The application validates the email addresses and sends the emails using Django's email-sending capabilities.
